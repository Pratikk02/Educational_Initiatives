Create a simple To-Do List Manager where users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. The user should also have the option to view all tasks or filter them based on their completion status.

**NOTE: The code lacks the memento pattern i.e., it lacks the undo or redo functions as those were not feasible by me.**
